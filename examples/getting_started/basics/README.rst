Basics (for newcomers)
----------------------

We recommend newcomers to take a quick look at the following tutorials
before going to practical EPR imaging applications. The first tutorial
contains short explanations about the backend system used to allow
simple CPU & GPU scripting, the second one presents tools for loading
EPR measurements in the BES3T (Bruker EPR Standard for Spectrum
Storage and Transfer) format used on Bruker ELEXSYS and EMX
spectrometers or in (the more generic) ASCII format. The last one
simply describes the EPR datasets used in further demonstration
examples.

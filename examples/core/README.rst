Core & low-level functions (for developers)
-------------------------------------------

This gallery of examples is mainly for users interested in using the
core functionalities of the PyEPRI in the design of their own EPR
applications. Users only interested by the higher level
functionalities of the PyEPRI package (e.g., EPR image reconstruction,
source separation, etc), can safely skip these tutorials.

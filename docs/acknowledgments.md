# Acknowledgments

This package was created and is maintained by [Rémy
Abergel](https://www.math-info.univ-paris5.fr/~rabergel) (Research
Engineer at CNRS & Université Paris Cité, MAP5 Laboratory) and would
never have existed without the fruitful scientific discussions and
helpful feedback he received from [Sylvain
Durand](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~sdurand/index.html)
(Professor at Université Paris Cité, MAP5 Laboratory) and [Yves-Michel
Frapart](https://lcbpt.biomedicale.parisdescartes.fr/bio-spectroscopy/epr-and-imaging/yves-frapart/)
(Senior Research Engineer at CNRS & Université Paris Cité, LCBPT),
founders of many of the applications presented in the provided
examples.

We would also like to thank the maintainers of several open source
projects for their hard work and their responsiveness in addressing
various issues we encountered during the development of PyEPRI.
  
+ [FINUFFT](https://finufft.readthedocs.io): the core functionalities
  of PyEPRI (i.e., projection and backprojection operations) heavily
  depend on the FINUFFT package for the computation of Nonuniform Fast
  Fourier Transforms. The speed and remarkably low memory consumption
  of FINUFFT were strong motivators behind the creation of PyEPRI. We
  would like to thank the FINUFFT Team for their availability and
  support on [Github](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/finufft).
  
+ [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) and
  [Sphinx-Gallery](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/): this
  documentation was created using Sphinx and the example galleries it
  contains were created using Sphinx-gallery. Special thanks to the
  Sphinx-gallery team for their kind support on
  [Github](https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery).
  
More generally, we thank the developers of the other packages or
projects ([Numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Cupy](https://cupy.dev/),
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [Pyvista](https://docs.pyvista.org/)
...) on which PyEPRI relies.

Finally, many thanks also to [Plateforme en Ligne
Mathrice](https://services.math.cnrs.fr/) for hosting the
[documentation of the PyEPRI
package](https://pyepri.math.cnrs.fr/), and more generally
for all the great digital services they offer to the French
mathematical community.
